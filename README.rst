Upload files directly to Rackspace from the browser
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Background
==========

We need to let users take files (possibly really big files) from their
hard drive and push them straight to the `Rackspace Cloud Files storage
service <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/>`.

We don't want the upload traffic anywhere near our servers.

Run the example
===============

If you don't have a rackspace account, you're not going to be able to
run this example, so go make one.

Also, my script depends on the `Pyrax
<https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax>` package, so install that, and then
do this stuff::

$ git clone git@github.com:216software/ajax-put-rackspace.git
$ cd ajax-put-rackspace
$ python apr.py YOUR_RACKSPACE_USER_NAME YOUR_API_KEY

Now open up http://localhost:8765 and you should see something like the
screenshot in before-upload.png

.. image:: before-upload.png

Now upload a file.  Hopefully, you'll watch a pretty blue scrollbar
track the upload's progress, and when it's done, you see something like
what's in this screenshot:

.. image:: after-upload.png

Click the DOWNLOAD button.  You will get the file you uploaded, but
named with a different name.

How we did it
=============

1.  Make a container in rackspace cloudfiles.

2.  Set metadata on that container to allow CORS from the domain hosting
    our HTML file.

3.  Make a temp URL that we can upload to.

4.  Write HTML to build a simple input type=file widget.

5.  Write javascript so that when a user picks a file with the file
    input tag, we use a `FileReader
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader>` to
    read the contents of the file into a buffer.

6.  Use more javascript to do an ajax PUT to the temp URL created
    in step 3.

The python part
===============

The Pyrax package made this easy.

Here's how to work with pyrax::

    $ pip install pyrax # this takes a while!
    $ python
    >>> import pyrax
    >>> pyrax.set_setting('identity_type',  'rackspace')
    >>> pyrax.set_credentials(YOUR_USER_NAME, YOUR_API_KEY, region="ORD")

You might need to set the region to something else besides ORD.

Now, make the container.  Don't worry!  Nothing stupid will happen if
your "uploads" container already exists.  You'll get a reference to the
existing container::

    >>> uploads_container = pyrax.cloudfiles.create_container('uploads')

Next set some metadata so that the browser will allow cross-domain
AJAX::

    >>> uploads_container.set_metadata({
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'http://localhost:8765'})

Replace localhost:8765 with your domain and replace http with https if
that's how you serve your site.

Next make a URL that you can give to the user's browser and say "send
your data to this".

    >>> import uuid
    >>> filename = str(uuid.uuid4())
    >>> upload_url = pyrax.cloudfiles.get_temp_url(
        uploads_container, filename, 60*60, method='PUT')

I'm using uuid.uuid4 to make a unique name, so that I never risk
uploading on top of existing data.

The other two arguments to get_temp_url are the number of seconds that
the URL lives for (60*60 means one hour) and the method='PUT' means this
is a URL that the browser will push to, not pull from.

In other words, after an hour, requests won't succeed, and only PUT
requests are allowed.

Like I said, the python part is really pretty easy!

Security considerations
=======================

The rackspace cloudfiles servers don't check if the request comes from
from a user that authenticated with your web application.

So, if a third party eavesdrops on the temporary URL we make, then it
can use curl or whatever tool they want to push a different file.

When you make a temporary URL, you need to make sure that the right
person and only the right person gets it.

How to set the filename for downloads
=====================================

Don't worry about how I'm using ugly-looking uuid filenames in the
upload URL.

You can build links to the actual file with any name you want.  You just
need to add a query-string parameter "filename" to the link, like this::

    <a href="{download_url}&filename=jokes-about-your-mom.pdf">download</a>

The relevant rackspace documentation is `here <http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/TempURL_File_Name_Overrides-d1e213.html>`.

The javascript part
===================

All the javascript lives in a big blob at the end of upload.html.  It's
a tangled mess of callbacks and closure variables.

**I would love it if somebody forked this repository and sent me a pull
request with a more elegant way to handle this stuff.**

Here's what the code does:

*   Sets an event listener on the on <input type="file"> tag::

        $("#upfile").on('change', function (e) {...

*   That event listener makes a FileReader instance named fr::

        var fr = new FileReader();

*   Then it sets a callback on the fr instance to handle when
    the fr instance finishes loading a file::

        fr.onload = (function (file_object, input_file_node) {...

*   Then it tells the fr instance to load in the file chosen by the user
    in the <input type="file"> tag::

        fr.readAsArrayBuffer(this.files[0]);

*   When the fr instance finishes reading all the data from inside the
    file, the onload callback fires.

*   Inside the onload callback, we use the good ol' jQuery $.ajax method
    to send the data from the file to rackspace.  It took us a while to
    figure out that the .result attribute holds data read in from the
    file::

        $.ajax({
            ...
            data: fr.result,
            ...
        });

*   The success callback for $.ajax request in this example code doesn't do
    anything interesting.  It just un-hides the link to the download
    URL::

        success: function (data) {
            console.debug('Upload complete -- do what you want here');
            $("div#download_url").collapse('show');
        },

*   It isn't necessary, but I want to show a progress bar in the browser
    as the file uploads.  So I made my own xhr object for the $.ajax code to
    use, and that xhr object notices the "progress" event::

        xhr: function() {

            var xhr = new window.XMLHttpRequest();

            // Upload progress
            xhr.upload.addEventListener("progress",

                function(evt) {{

                    if (evt.lengthComputable) {

                        var percentComplete = evt.loaded / evt.total;

                        console.debug('percentComplete: ' + percentComplete);

                        $("#progress-bar div.progress-bar").css('width',
                            String(100*percentComplete) + "%");

                    }
                },
                false);

            return xhr;
            },

And that's about it!  If the example doesn't work for you, please let me
know.  And I hope somebody can clean up the javascript!  Triple-nested
callbacks ain't my idea of a good time.


Alternate solutions
===================

Handle the upload and then push to rackspace
--------------------------------------------

The rookie solution involves writing some web application code to accept
the file upload from the browser, save it to /tmp (or hell, just store
it in memory), and then upload it to rackspace.

To be a little faster, perhaps just the first half happens during during
the web request, and some unrelated background process uploads the file
to rackspace later.

Risks with this approach
------------------------

We're using the fantastic `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>` WSGI server
with regular plain-jane vanilla sync workers.

Remember that with a synchronous worker, when a user makes a request,
that request completely ties up the back-end worker process until it
replies.  That's why you need a bunch of sync workers working
simultaneously.  A request that comes in will get handled by one of the
idle workers -- as long as somebody is idle.  Otherwise, requests queue
up.

When too many users try to upload too many really big files at the same
time, then all of the workers could be tied up, and the application
would become unresponsive.

We could always just keep a ton of web application processes around, so
that no matter how busy the application gets, we always have some idle
workers, but that's a worst-case solution.  That's like dealing with a
weight problem by buying a bigger pair of pants.


What about using async workers?
===============================

Well, first of all, I want to get the files up to rackspace, and this
way gets that done better.

But in other related scenarios, it would be nice to have the uploaded
data in the application server.

Under the hood, these async libraries all monkey-patch stuff like the
socket library, so that when you read or write from a socket, you
automatically yield, so that other coroutines can use the CPU while you
block for IO to complete.

Here's the problem that we ran into (which is likely totally fixable, or
even never was broken).

We're using the werkzeug library to parse file uploads.  It internally
pulls data from the socket named "wsgi.input" passed in with the WSGI
environ.

We couldn't figure out how to force the werkzeug request object to
intermittently yield to the gevent scheduler while reading from the
wsgi.input socket.

So while our async worker was reading the gigantic file being uploaded,
even though the async worker was blocking on IO, it was not switching to
go back and answer other requests.

I'd love to learn how to fix this, so please, help me out.
